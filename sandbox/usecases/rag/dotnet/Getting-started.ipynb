An attempt to outsmart the market by spending a little extra time and effort will primarily result in below-average gains.\\r\\nConfusing speculation with investment can be a costly mistake. Speculators buy hot stocks based on future growth prospects. In contrast, investment is made on a thorough analysis of the underlying business to ensure the safety of principal and adequate \\u2014 but not extraordinary \\u2014 gain. Invest in a stock only when you can comfortably own it without following its daily share price.\\r\\nIf you cannot resist the urge to bet on the next big growth stock, set strict limits on speculation. Keep a separate speculative account with less than 10% of your capital for speculative activities. Never mix money from the investment account and speculation account.\",\"Enterprising investors\\u0027 confidence in their professional analysis may reduce their stock component to 25% when the markets are dangerously high and raise their stock component to 75% at the bottom of a bear market. However, a minimum of 25% in bonds is essential as it will give investors the cushion to hold on to stocks even through the worst bear markets.\\r\\nPurchase only tax-free municipal bonds unless you fall in the lowest tax bracket. Choose bonds that mature in five to 10 years as they remain relatively stable with interest rate fluctuations. Bond funds are an excellent choice for individual investors as they offer cheap and easy diversification to minimize risk.\\r\\nBoth Graham and Warren Buffet recommend index funds as the best long-term bet for defensive investors.

Defensive investors can achieve a decent result with minimum effort and capability. However, even a marginal improvement from this result is challenging and requires extraordinary knowledge and skill. An attempt to outsmart the market by spending a little extra time and effort will primarily result in below-average gains.\\r\\nConfusing speculation with investment can be a costly mistake. Speculators buy hot stocks based on future growth prospects. In contrast, investment is made on a thorough analysis of the underlying business to ensure the safety of principal and adequate \\u2014 but not extraordinary \\u2014 gain. Invest in a stock only when you can comfortably own it without following its daily share price.\\r\\nIf you cannot resist the urge to bet on the next big growth stock, set strict limits on speculation. Keep a separate speculative account with less than 10% of your capital for speculative activities. Never mix money from the investment account and speculation account.&quot;,&quot;Enterprising investors\\u0027 confidence in their professional analysis may reduce their stock component to 25% when the markets are dangerously high and raise their stock component to 75% at the bottom of a bear market. However, a minimum of 25% in bonds is essential as it will give investors the cushion to hold on to stocks even through the worst bear markets.\\r\\nPurchase only tax-free municipal bonds unless you fall in the lowest tax bracket. Choose bonds that mature in five to 10 years as they remain relatively stable with interest rate fluctuations. Bond funds are an excellent choice for individual investors as they offer cheap and easy diversification to minimize risk.\\r\\nBoth Graham and Warren Buffet recommend index funds as the best long-term bet for defensive investors. Index funds own a cross-section of the entire market without any stock selection. While they may be unglamorous and show steady returns compared to more aggressive funds, index funds have low risk and have historically outperformed most mutual funds over 20 year periods.&quot;]</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table><style>\r\n",
