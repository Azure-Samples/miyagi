For someone who is {{UserProfilePlugin.GetUserAge $userId}} years old, with {{UserProfilePlugin.GetAnnualHouseholdIncome $userId}} as household income, and with a risk tolerance of {{$risk}}, what recommendation would {{$voice}} give.
Return well-formed JSON with a "gptRecommendation" property containing {{$voice}}'s' recommendation in a creative and funny tone.
Example: {"portfolio":[{"symbol":"MSFT","gptRecommendation":"Booyah! Hold on, steady growth! Diversify, though!"},{"symbol":"PEP","gptRecommendation":"Buy, buy, buy! Solid dividends, sweet stability!"}]}
