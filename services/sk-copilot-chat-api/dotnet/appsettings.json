  // Default AI service configuration for generating AI responses and embeddings from the user's input.
  // https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat
  // To use Azure OpenAI as the AI completion service:
  // - Set "Type" to "AzureOpenAI" 
  // - Set "Endpoint" to the endpoint of your Azure OpenAI instance (e.g., "https://contoso.openai.azure.com")
  // - Set "Key" using dotnet's user secrets (see above)
  //     (i.e. dotnet user-secrets set "AIService:Key" "MY_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY")
  //
  // To use OpenAI as the AI completion service:
  // - Set "Type" to "OpenAI"
  // - Set "Key" using dotnet's user secrets (see above)
  //     (i.e. dotnet user-secrets set "AIService:Key" "MY_OPENAI_KEY")
  //
  // - Set Completion and Planner models to a chat completion model (e.g., gpt-35-turbo, gpt-4).
  // - Set the Embedding model to an embedding model (e.g., "text-embedding-ada-002").
  //

  //
  // Planner can determine which skill functions, if any, need to be used to fulfill a user's request.
  // https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts-sk/planner
