### Task 1: Clone miyagi app

1. Create a new folder for the workshop
1. Start Visual Studio Code and Open the new folder: File -> Open Folder -> Select the folder you created in step 1
1. Open a new terminal: Terminal -> New Terminal (or Ctrl + Shift + `)   
1. Clone this repo
   
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi.git

   ```
### Task 2: Provision Azure Resources required for Miyagi app

1. Change folder to miyagi/deploy/infrastructure/cli
   
   ```
    cd miyagi/deploy/infrastructure/cli
   ```
2. Login to Azure and select the subscription you want to use for the workshop
   
   ```
    az login
    az account set --subscription "<your subscription id>"

   ```
3. Run the following command to create the Azure resources needed for the workshop. The script will create a resource group for each of the workshop participants, and will create the required resources in each resource group. You will need to provide a subscription id, and optionally a resource group prefix, location, and the number of resource groups you want. The script will default to the values below if not provided. Pick the deployment type based on whether you want to deploy the workshop for Azure Container Apps (ACA) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
   
   **ACA Lab**
   ```
    ./deploy.ps1  -resourceGroupPrefix "<miyagi>" -location "<eastus2>" -resourceGroupCount "<1>" -subscriptionId "<your subscription id>" -deploymentType "aca"
   ```

   **AKS Lab**
   ```
    ./deploy.ps1  -resourceGroupPrefix "<miyagi>" -location "<eastus2>" -resourceGroupCount "<1>" -subscriptionId "<your subscription id>" -deploymentType "aca"
   ```
   Note: If you are setting up the workshop just for you, make sure you set the value of resourceGroupCount to 1
4. Wait until the script completes. It will take less than 10 minutes to complete.
5. Bump up the capacity for Open AI model deployments

   By default the Open AI model are deployed with 1K Tokens per minute (TPM) capacity. This is not enough for the workshop. You will need to bump up the capacity to 20K Tokens per minute. You can do this by going to Azure Portal -> Resource Groups -> Select the resource group you created in step 3 of the previous section -> Select the Open AI resource -> Overview -> Click Go to Azure OpenAI Studio -> Deployments -> Select the deployment for gpt-35-turbo model -> Click Edit Deployment -> Advanced Options -> Slide the TPM slider to 20K -> Click Save and close.
   
   Repeat the same steps for the deployment for text-embedding-ada-002 model.

### Task 3: Understanding implementation of the recommendation service

Recommendation service implements RAG pattern using Semantic Kernel SDK. The details of the implementation are captured in the Jupyter notebook in the folder miyagi/sandbox/usecases/rag/dotnet. You can open the notebook in VSCode and run the cells to understand step by step details of how the Recommendation Service is implemented. Pay special attention to how RAG pattern is implemented using Semantic Kernel. Select kernel as .NET Interactive in the top right corner of the notebook.

1. In Visual Studio Code navigate to **miyagi/sandbox/usecases/rag/dotnet** folder and select **Getting-started.ipynb**

   ![](./Media/image-rg-23.png)

1. Execute the notebook cell by cell (using either Ctrl + Enter to stay on the same cell or Shift + Enter to advance to the next cell) and observe the results of each cell execution.
   
      **Note:** Please make sure that you are not running all the cells together as it can lead to exceeding the Azure OpenAI TPM limit and you may face an issue with 503 Service unreachable. You will need to wait for few minutes before running the cells again to fix the 503 issue.

   ![](./Media/run.png)

 1. Once after Excuting all the cell you need see the output as shown in below diagram.
