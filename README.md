Project Miyagi serves as the foundation for an [envisioning workshop](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/intelligent-app-workshop) that reimagines the design, development, and deployment of intelligent applications using Microsoft's [Copilot stack](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/microsoft-outlines-framework-for-building-ai-apps-and-copilots-expands-ai-plugin-ecosystem/). It demonstrates that integrating intelligence transcends a simple chat interface and permeates every aspect of your product experience, utilizing semantic data to generate personalized interactions and effectively address individual needs. Through a comprehensive exploration of generative and discriminative [use cases](https://iappwksp.com/wksp/05-use-cases/), Miyagi offers hands-on experience with cutting-edge programming paradigms that harness the power of foundation models in every workflow. Additionally, it introduces traditional software engineers to emerging design patterns in prompt engineering (chain-of-thought, few-shot, retrieval-augmentation), vectorization for long-term memory, and tools or affordances to augment and ground LLMs.

The project includes examples of usage for popular frameworks and orchestrators such as [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/#semantic-kernel-is-at-the-center-of-the-copilot-stack), [Guidance](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance), [Promptflow](https://promptflow.azurewebsites.net/overview-what-is-prompt-flow.html), [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index), [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain#readme), vector stores ([Azure Cognitive Search](https://github.com/Azure/cognitive-search-vector-pr), [CosmosDB Postgres pgvector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/howto-use-pgvector), and [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)), and generative image utilities such as [DreamFusion](https://huggingface.co/thegovind/reddogpillmodel512) and [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet). Additionally, it features fine-tuned foundation Models from AzureML. Utilize this project to gain insights as you modernize and transform your applications with AI and fine-tune your private data to build your own Copilot.

Embedded with intelligence and built on a scalable event-driven architecture, Project Miyagi emphasizes customer-centricity. It challenges you to rethink how AI can curate and create hyper-personalized user interactions, whether in a line-of-business (LOB) or consumer-facing app. It features an easy-to-understand use case that offers concrete examples of how the capabilities in these new AI platforms and architectures, supported by Azure, can be leveraged for valuable insights.

This polyglot codebase relies on a multitude of microservices, implementing several [use cases](https://iappwksp.com/wksp/05-use-cases/) using our Copilot stack. It includes generative text and images for personalized financial coaching, summarization, and agent-like orchestration. Built on a cloud-native EDA backbone, the architecture and codebase ensures enterprise-grade quality attributes such as availability, scalability, and maintainability.

Embark on a journey to transform your applications into cutting-edge, intelligent systems with the self-guided workshop and discover the art of the possible.
