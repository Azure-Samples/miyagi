Project Miyagi is an AI-first architecture and user experience showcase. It serves as a sandbox to explore and diffuse emerging programming paradigms that are developed using the attention mechanism, such as GPT-x. In addition, it introduces, to traditional software engineers, nascent design patterns in prompt engineering (chain-of-thought, few-shot, in-context), indexing nascent design patterns in prompt engineering, indexing for memory, and affordances to traditional software engineers. For instance, some of the design patterns highlighted include chain-of-thought, few-shot, in-context, vector stores, embeddings, conversational memory stores, and document loaders.

The project also includes examples of usage for popular frameworks like [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain#readme), vector stores ([Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/), [Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)), [SD-InstructPix2Pix](https://github.com/timothybrooks/instruct-pix2pix), [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet). Additionally, it features foundation Models from Azure OpenAI and [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-a-renaissance-in-computer-vision-ai-with-microsofts-florence-foundation-model). Utilize this project to gain insights as you modernize and transform your applications with AI and fine-tune your private data to build your own private copilot.

Embedded with intelligence and built on a scalable event-driven architecture, Project Miyagi emphasizes customer-centricity. It challenges you to rethink how AI can elevate and hyper-personalize your customers' experiences, whether in a line-of-business (LOB) or consumer-facing app. It features an easy-to-understand use case that offers concrete examples of how these new AI platforms and architectures, supported by Azure, can be leveraged for valuable insights.

This polyglot codebase relies on a multitude of microservices, choreographing retail and high-frequency trading. It includes generative text and images for personalized financial coaching, summarization, and agent-like orchestration. Built on a cloud-native EDA backbone, the architecture and codebase ensures enterprise-grade quality attributes such as availability, scalability, and maintainability.

Embark on a journey to transform your applications into cutting-edge, intelligent systems with the self-guided workshop and discover the art of the possible.

### Partial Implementations

Due to the rapid pace of advancements in foundation models, we are incrementally implementing use cases for Miyagi in the experiments folder. So far, we have the following implemented:

1. [Knowledge Graph memory using Langchain's entity cache](./ancillary/experiments/langchain/Memory_Usecases.ipynb)
2. [Qdrant vector store for embeddings via Langchain](./ancillary/experiments/langchain/qdrant_miyagi_example)
3. [MS Graph API intent invoked via Semantic Kernel's skills](./ancillary/experiments/semantic-kernel/ms-graph-chain)
4. [Miyagi prompt engineered chat interaction](./ancillary/experiments/langchain/chat) using LangChain's PromptTemplate 
5. [Azure OpenAI GPT-3.5 basic flow](./ancillary/experiments/az-openai)
6. [GPT-3.5-turbo and Whisper-1 usage to transcribe audio and demonstrate few-shot example](./ancillary/experiments/gpt-3.5-turbo)
